# Safeblur
 Safeblur is an image processing platform designed to detect and censor sensitive content in historical Filipino colonial photographs. Utilizing the capabilities of Mask R-CNN, SafeBlur performs object detection and segmentation to identify instances of violence, nudity, and weapons of war. By automatically blurring these elements, the platform ensures that archival images can be shared while minimizing exposure to graphic or distressing content.
